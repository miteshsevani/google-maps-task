Omnifi Web Developer Test
Author: Mitesh Sevani

This is the Vanilla JS version of Omnifi's web developer test using google maps.

I have used my own Google Maps API Key

Due to blocking of CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' for the location feed, for testing purposes, I disabled CORS 
on chrome via the Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * extention - chrome://extensions/?id=nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
